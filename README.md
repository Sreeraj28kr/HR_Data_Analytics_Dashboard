ðŸ“‰Through out the project here are the key actions I undertook:
1. Started by cleaning and transforming the data to derive proper insights.
2. Included some important KPIs like Employee Count, Attrition Count, Attrition Rate, Active Employees, and Average Age.
3. Added the Job Satisfaction Rating of the employees from different departments within the organization.
4. Used different types of customized visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, Lollypop graphs, etc.

ðŸ“‰Insights :  In the technology and IT industry, attrition rates can vary but are often higher compared to other sectors. An attrition rate of around 16% may be considered average or even slightly below average in this industry. If we check department-wise attrition we can see that R&D has the highest number which is 56.12% and that isn't good for the organization. The highest number of people leaving the organization is between the age group of 25-34. The Education Field wise attrition indicates that the highest number of people leaving the organization are from the field of Life science followed by Medical and Marketing.
